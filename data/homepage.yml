      content: "
Carola is a very applied junior developer eager to grow as a professional. Being part of our team was her first professional experience on the IT sector. As it is common for a new employee, we were expecting an adaptation period of one or many months. Nonetheless, we were surprised by her ability to solve problems by herself, assuming the responsibility or her tasks with autonomy and confidence. In a short time she was familiar with our technological stack and managed to develop applications from start to finish, from the functional definition to production (in web and mobile apps)."
